Following the success of Round 1 and Round 2, with a total of $4.4M in Permanent liquidity rewards, BNB Chain is launching a $100M Liquidity Incentive for CEX Listings. This initiative aims to further enhance BNB Chain’s ecosystem liquidity and foster project growth by incentivizing exchanges to list native BNB Chain tokens, strengthening on-chain liquidity, and solidifying market foundations.

This round of liquidity support will cover all sectors, including meme, AI, DeFi, gaming, and more. Rewards will be distributed on a first-come, first-served basis to projects that meet the criteria. We look forward to seeing more high-quality assets being issued on the BNB Chain.

The program starts immediately upon announcement. It will initially run as a 3-month trial period, with the possibility of long-term continuation based on performance evaluation.
