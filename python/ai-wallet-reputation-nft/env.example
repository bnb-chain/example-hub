# --- Blockchain Configuration ---

# Choose ONE option below (A or B) and uncomment the relevant lines
# while keeping the other option commented out.

# --- Option A: Deploy Your Own Contract (Default) ---
# Required: URL of your chosen BNB Chain Testnet RPC node
# Example is for BSC Testnet. Find others at https://chainlist.org/?testnets=true&search=bnb
RPC_URL="https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.bnbchain.org:8545/"
# Required: Address of the ReputationBadge (ERC-721) contract you deployed in Step 4A.
CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0xbcb007cfb669d12beff8b312e3ce652bd0307ed0" 
# Pre-deployed address for BSC Testnet, replace with your own address if deploying your own contract
# Associated block explorer URL (Default: BSC Testnet)
TESTNET_SCAN_URL="https://testnet.bscscan.com"


# --- Option B: Use Pre-Deployed Contract on BSC Testnet ---
# Uncomment the following 3 lines (and comment out Option A lines) to use this option.
# RPC_URL="https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.bnbchain.org:8545/" # BSC Testnet RPC
# CONTRACT_ADDRESS="0xbcb007cfb669d12beff8b312e3ce652bd0307ed0" # Pre-deployed address
# TESTNET_SCAN_URL="https://testnet.bscscan.com" # BSC Testnet Scan


# --- Required for BOTH Options ---

# Required: Private key of the wallet that deployed (or owns) the specified CONTRACT_ADDRESS.
# This wallet pays gas fees for minting badges via the backend.
# Ensure this wallet has Testnet BNB (See README Prerequisites).
# If using Option B, this key MUST belong to the owner of the pre-deployed contract
# (0xbcb...) for backend minting to work as-is. See README note.
# WARNING: USE A DEDICATED TESTNET/BURNER WALLET KEY. Never commit mainnet keys.
PRIVATE_KEY="YOUR_DEPLOYER_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY"


# --- LLM Configuration ---

# Required: API Key for your chosen LLM Service Provider.
# The current backend code (`src/analyzer.py`) is configured to use the OpenRouter API endpoint.
# See comments in this file and `src/analyzer.py` for how to adapt to other providers.
# For the default OpenRouter setup, get key from https://openrouter.ai/keys
# IMPORTANT: Keep your API key secure. Do not commit the `.env` file.
OPENROUTER_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY" # Change name & value if NOT using default OpenRouter setup


# --- Optional Configuration ---

# Optional: Transaction count thresholds for reputation scoring
MIN_TX_COUNT_EXPLORER=10
MIN_TX_COUNT_CONTRIBUTOR=50
MIN_TX_COUNT_VETERAN=200
MIN_TX_COUNT_LEGEND=1000

# Note: TESTNET_SCAN_URL is set under Option A/B above. Ensure it matches the RPC_URL network.
